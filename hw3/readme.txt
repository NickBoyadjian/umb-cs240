The hardest part about this project was working with strings. Because the
original input was integers we had to convert it back and forth betweens
characters and integers when doing the conversions. I basically tried to keep my
code as simple as possible and not have huge functions. For example I needed to
compute powers of a number so I broke the logic into its own function rather
than having one giant function. 
The biggest thing I learned from this project was doing the type conversions and
working with character arrays. I've done base conversions in C++ before so
that part was more or less pretty simple.
