Homework 4

I found the first part of this homework to be pretty straight forward. The
functions were all just one line expressions. The only one that took me a minute
was the full adder carry but i solved it using two "||" operators. The last part
was the trickiest. Going through the steps of the myadd function werent too bad
as it was all layed out in the rubric but getting and setting bits in an
unsigned integer were a little bit more tricky. 
Once I learned how to do it I was able to solve the problem but it took a bit of
research to get there. What I had to do was left shift the value of 1, i times
and then do a bitwise and operation, and the right shift the value back i times.
I put that into its own function and then just called it from within my for
loop. This kept the code clean and easy to read / follow.

For my sources, this page was the biggest help.
